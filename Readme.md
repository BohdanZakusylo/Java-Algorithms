# Algorithms and Datastructures

## 📌 Overview

Our project is a demonstration of parsing data and from the data the 
creation of different datastructures and algorithms in a generic

If running the code on MacOS does not work (we have experienced visual bugs), please try it on a Windows laptop


###  Binary Search Tree

- `JumpSearch()` — **O(√n)**
- `BinarySearch()` — **O(log n)**

### Queue

- `MergeSort()` — **O(n log n)**
- `SelectionSort()` — **O(n²)**

### Stack

- `QuickSort(n)` — **O(n log n)** average, **O(n²)** worst-case

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JAVA >= 17+
- Intellij 
- git

### Installation
1. ```git clone https://github.com/BohdanZakusylo/Java-Algorithms```
2. Open the project in Intellij
3. Pres the start button on the top right corner of the IDE


### Application Tutorial

1. When starting the application you need to import data first.
2. Click on Import Data
3. Choose a csv data file 
4. After uploading the file, click on the dropdown box next to it to select the data points to use. 
5. Once selected click the Apply Data button to have the data used in the system.
6. A small text box under the Apply Data button should confirm if this was successful. 
7. After this you can choose the data structure you would like to data to be implemented in, and within that you can click on the algorithm to use on it.
8. Any button with a red warning label next to it, will take minutes to execute due to its poor time complexity
9. If you would like to use the search algorithms in the binary search tree, first input the desired element to search box on the right side and then click the algorithm to search for the element.
